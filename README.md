Here are the slides for my Sonar presentation given at  MD Software Patterns and Practices meeting

and MCJUG meeting

To render the slides you need my custom verion of Wiki2Beamer that supports title slides and Latex with all latest beamer packages installed.

You'll find Wiki2Beamer here https://github.com/vladistan/wiki2beamer.  You can get Latex and Beamer from usual sources
